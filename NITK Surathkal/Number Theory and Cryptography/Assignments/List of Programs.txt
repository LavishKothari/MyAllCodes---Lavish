1 - Number system conversion

2 - Finding number of bit operations in 
                Addition  
                Multiplication
                Finding prime factors
                Binary to decimal conversion

3 - Write a program to find gcd of two numbers using Euclid's approach.
	Express 1 as the linear combination of two co-primes using the above program.
	Or in general express GCD(a,b) as the linear combination of a and b
  
4 - Find out Euler's phi function for a power of a prime.
	Also give the list of all these numbers.

5 - Implementation of Seive of Eratosthenes
	and counting the number of bit operations

6 - Design crypto-system and crypt-analysis System

7 - Construct a hash function which takes university roll number and generates 2 digit
	integer out of it. Use this hash function to map a class of 54 students on to an integer.
	Out of 54 students, 27 are from Mtech CSE and other 27 are from Mtech CSE-IS
	Try developing the inverse hash function.

8 - Steps for Encryption : 
		Take a message from the user
		divide the message in blocks of 4
		reverse each block
		treat each block as a base 26 number,
		find equivalent decimal of above number
		multiply the equivalent number by 37
		add 96 to above number
		finally convert the number to base 16.
		This is the encrypted form of the number.
		Also perform the reverse of this process to get back the original message.

9 - Print the nth digit of the sequence   12345678910111213141516171819202122.....9899100101102....

10 - Write a program to print all the circular primes before 1 million
	 This program uses seive of Eratosthenes to do so.

11 - Find the powers of all the prime factors of 100!
